# Flask

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI] web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug]
and [Jinja], and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.

## A Simple Example

```python
# save this as app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```
$ flask run
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

## Features

- Simple Flask application to accept date/time input
- Example HTML form (in `templates/`) to pick date and time
- Static assets in `static/` and supporting images in `assets/`
- Minimal, easy-to-read code you can adapt for learning or small projects

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (or install from requirements if provided)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Raditya808/flask-app-py-datetime-input.git
   cd flask-app-py-datetime-input

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

3. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   If there is no `requirements.txt`, install Flask directly:

   pip install Flask

## Running the app

There are two common ways to run the application:

- With Flask's development server:

  export FLASK_APP=main.py
  export FLASK_ENV=development
  flask run

  (On Windows PowerShell use `setx FLASK_APP main.py` and `setx FLASK_ENV development`, or run the file directly.)

- Or run directly with Python if `main.py` includes an entrypoint:

  python main.py

By default the app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 — open this in your browser to see the form and try submitting a date/time.

## Usage

- Open the app in a browser, fill in the date/time fields and submit the form.
- The app demonstrates basic server-side handling of datetime input (parsing/form validation may be implemented in `main.py`).



## License

If you want to include a license, add a `LICENSE` file. Otherwise consider adding an MIT or other permissive license.

---

If you want, I can also create a `requirements.txt`, a short CONTRIBUTING.md, or update `main.py` to include `requirements.txt`-style comments. Please tell me what you'd like next.
